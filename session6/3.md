Helpful Reminder:

bits = 0xe93c0118
Remember this is little-endian! Actual big-endian version is 0x18062776
Take the first byte as the “exponent” and the other three bytes as the “coefficient”
Exponent = 0x18 = 24
Coefficient = 0x013ce9
Plug into this formula:
Target = Coefficient * 2(8*(Exponent - 3))

The lowest difficulty allowed corresponds to these bits: 0x1d00ffff
Exponent = 0x1d = 29
Coefficient = 0x00ffff

Difficulty = Lowest Difficulty / Target

1. Calculate the target and difficulty for these bits:

0xf2881718
